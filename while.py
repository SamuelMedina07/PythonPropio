""" 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on 
a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are 
between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is 
$15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost 
of their movie ticket 
Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value """
